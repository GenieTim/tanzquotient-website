tq-website
==========

The WebSite developed for the TanzQuotient at ETH Zurich.

For users:
----------
There are [Howtos for the non-programming people](https://github.com/tanzquotient/tq_website/wiki/Howtos)

For programmers:
----------------
There are different kinds of documentation:
- **The "old documentation":** [DEPRECATED]<br />
  .rst files located in the ```docs/``` subfolder (except the ```docs/sphinx``` folder). They contain early versions of Howtos and instructions on [how to setup the local development environment](https://github.com/tanzquotient/tq_website/blob/master/docs/dev/setup.md).
- **The "new documentation":** [DEPRECATED]<br />
  Located in [our Github wiki](https://github.com/tanzquotient/tq_website/wiki). It contains tips and tricks as well as solutions to some grave problems that have occurred in the past so that they don't happen again.
- **The "future/unified documentation":**<br />
  This documentation is automatically generated at https://tq-website.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ using the documentation in ```docs/sphinx```. At the moment, we are migrating towards that platform because it's independent of the code hosting and can even be generated offline.<br />
  This documentation will contain all the other documentations in the end.

Please see the [project documentation](docs/index.md) for further details.
