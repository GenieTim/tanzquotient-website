- If you are enrolling to a couple course, you can enrol together with your partner. For this, enter his/her email address in the field "Partner email". Note that this must be the email address that your partner uses in his TQ account. You can also enrol alone, and we will try to find a partner for you.
- Not required: Give us some hints about your experience and/or other comments.
- Check the checkbox.
- Click on the "Anmelden" button.
- Congratulations, you have successfully enrolled! Check your email account for a confirmation email, click the link in it and wait for a second email from us where we confirm your enrolment definitely.

I have problems enrolling
-------------------------

When I try to enrol my partner, the system says that nobody with this email is registered. But when I try to create an account for this email address, it says that this address is already used.

- **Solution (student):**

  Contact the website admin by email informatik [at] tq.vseth.ch, or use the support chat `<https://t.me/joinchat/AlE6nw89dgmPvObM8kcKQA>`_.

- **Solution (TQ responsible person):**

  This is a multiaccount issue caused by an old version of the website. It was possible to enrol without an account, but the system internally created an account, which led to the situation that there were multiple accounts associated with the same email address. Fixed on the 1st of April 2018.
  
  - Search for the user profiles.
  - Select the one where the last login lies further back. If no "last login" time is set, this means that the last login was very long ago.
  - Inactivate this profile by removing the "Active" checkbox.

Export (payment) information of the teachers
--------------------------------------------

The following steps refer to the buttons in the admin panel. If you cannot see them, you probably don't have enough rights. Please contact the administrator in this case.

- Go to Courses --> Course offerings.
