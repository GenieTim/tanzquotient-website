# This file defines environment variables for the TQ website

# The format is as follows:
# TQ_ENVIRONMENT_VAR: [SIP_ENVIRONMENT_VAR, default_value]
#
# Types to not really matter, the YAML parser takes care of that
# Thus no need to define as strings (with "") unless explicitly needed (e.g. to list the allowed hosts)

# docker-compose default overwrites (see https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/)
